Kubernetes offers a variety of deployment strategies. This guide explores six key strategies—Rolling Updates, Blue-Green, Canary, A/B Testing, Shadow, and Recreate—providing clear explanations and practical examples to help implement them effectively.

## Why Deployment Strategies Matter

Deploying applications in Kubernetes requires balancing reliability, user experience, and rollback capabilities. Each strategy serves specific use cases, such as ensuring zero downtime, testing new features, or evaluating user behavior. Choosing the right strategy depends on the application's requirements and operational goals.

## 1. Rolling Update Deployment

Rolling Update is the default Kubernetes deployment strategy, designed for seamless updates with zero downtime. It gradually replaces old pods with new ones, maintaining application availability.

**How it works**: Kubernetes scales up new pods while scaling down old ones, controlled by `maxSurge` (extra pods allowed) and `maxUnavailable` (pods that can be unavailable).

**When to use it**: Ideal for applications requiring continuous availability, such as web services.

**Example**:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: app:1.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
```

This configuration updates the `app` to version 1.1, adding one new pod at a time (`maxSurge: 1`) while ensuring no pods are unavailable (`maxUnavailable: 0`). Apply it with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

## 2. Blue-Green Deployment

Blue-Green deployment enables instant switching to a new version with a straightforward rollback option. It maintains two environments: "Blue" (current version) and "Green" (new version). Traffic switches to Green once it’s ready.

**How it works**: The new version deploys alongside the current one, and a Service update redirects traffic to the new pods.

**When to use it**: Suitable for critical releases needing fast rollback, such as major application updates.

**Example**:

Deploy the Blue environment (version 1.0):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-blue
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app
      version: blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app
        version: blue
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: app:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: app
    version: blue
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

Deploy the Green environment (version 1.1):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-green
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app
      version: green
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app
        version: green
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: app:1.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Switch traffic to Green by updating the Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: app
    version: green
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

Apply with `kubectl apply -f <file>.yaml`. If issues occur, revert the Service to `version: blue` for rollback.

## 3. Canary Deployment

Canary deployment tests a new version with a small user subset before full rollout, minimizing risk.

**How it works**: A few pods run the new version, and a small percentage of traffic is routed to them, typically via an Ingress controller.

**When to use it**: Useful for validating new features or stability in production.

**Example**:

Deploy the main app (version 1.0) and a canary (version 1.1):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: app:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-canary
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app-canary
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app-canary
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: app:1.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: app
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-canary-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: app-canary
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

Route 90% traffic to the main app and 10% to the canary using an NGINX Ingress:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: app.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app-service
            port:
              number: 80
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app-canary-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: "10"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: app.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app-canary-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

Monitor the canary pods, and if stable, scale up the canary deployment and phase out the old version.

## 4. A/B Testing Deployment

A/B Testing evaluates different versions by routing specific user segments to each, focusing on user behavior (e.g., UI changes) rather than just stability.

**How it works**: Multiple versions run concurrently, with traffic split based on user attributes (e.g., headers, cookies) using an Ingress or service mesh like Istio.

**When to use it**: Best for testing feature variations to optimize metrics like conversion rates.

**Example**:

Deploy two versions (e.g., version A with a blue button, version B with a red button):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-a
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app
      version: a
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app
        version: a
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: app:blue-button
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-b
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app
      version: b
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app
        version: b
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: app:red-button
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-a-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: app
    version: a
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-b-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: app
    version: b
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

Route traffic based on a header (e.g., `user-type: premium` to version B):

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: app.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app-a-service
            port:
              number: 80
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app-b-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header: "user-type"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-by-header-value: "premium"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: app.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app-b-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

Analyze metrics (e.g., click-through rates) to determine the winning version, then scale it up.

## 5. Shadow Deployment

Shadow deployment tests a new version by mirroring production traffic to it without affecting users, acting as a production dry run.

**How it works**: The new version receives duplicated traffic via a service mesh (e.g., Istio) or proxy, processing requests without serving responses to users.

**When to use it**: Ideal for testing performance or behavior under real traffic conditions.

**Example**:

Deploy the production app (version 1.0) and a shadow version (1.1):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: app:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-shadow
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app-shadow
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app-shadow
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: app:1.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  clothed: app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: app
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-shadow-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: app-shadow
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
```

Mirror traffic to the shadow deployment using Istio:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: app-vs
spec:
  hosts:
  - app.example.com
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: app-service
      weight: 100
    mirror:
      host: app-shadow-service
```

Monitor the shadow pods’ logs and metrics to validate version 1.1 before a full rollout.

## 6. Recreate Deployment

Recreate is the simplest but most disruptive strategy, terminating all old pods before deploying new ones, causing downtime.

**How it works**: Kubernetes deletes existing pods, then starts the new version.

**When to use it**: Suitable for non-critical applications where downtime is acceptable, such as internal tools.

**Example**:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: app:1.1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
```

Apply with `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`. Users experience downtime until new pods are ready.

## Best Practices

- **Monitor Deployments**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics.
- **Automate with CI/CD**: Leverage ArgoCD or GitHub Actions for streamlined deployments.
- **Test in Staging**: Validate strategies in a non-production environment.
- **Use Readiness Probes**: Ensure pods are healthy before receiving traffic.
- **Plan Rollbacks**: Maintain clear rollback procedures, especially for Blue-Green, Canary, and A/B Testing.

## Common Challenges

- **Resource Usage**: Blue-Green and Shadow require double resources due to parallel environments.
- **Traffic Splitting**: Canary and A/B Testing need robust Ingress or service mesh for accurate routing.
- **Stateful Applications**: These strategies suit stateless apps; use migrations for databases.
- **Shadow Metrics**: Set up logging and monitoring for shadow deployments to analyze performance.
