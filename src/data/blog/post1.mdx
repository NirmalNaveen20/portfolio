# Getting Started with Datadog

Datadog is a powerful observability platform that helps monitor your infrastructure, applications, logs, and more‚Äîall in one place. Whether you're working with cloud platforms, containers, or microservices, Datadog offers real-time insights to ensure everything runs smoothly.

---

## Why Use Datadog?

- Centralized monitoring for infrastructure, apps, logs, and APM  
- Over 600+ integrations with tools like AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins  
- Custom dashboards for visualizing metrics  
- Alerting and incident detection using monitors  
- Easy-to-install agent for collecting host metrics

---

## Step 1: Install the Datadog Agent

To get started, install the Datadog Agent on your system.

Example for Ubuntu:

```bash
DD_API_KEY=<your_api_key> bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script.sh)"
```

Check the agent status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status datadog-agent
```

For Windows or macOS, follow the steps from **Integrations > Agent** in your Datadog dashboard.

---

## Step 2: Create Dashboards

Datadog dashboards help visualize your metrics and logs.

1. Go to **Dashboards > New Dashboard**
2. Add a widget like a **timeseries graph** or **query value**
3. Select a metric, such as:

```text
system.cpu.user{env:production}
```

You can filter dashboards using tags (`env`, `region`, etc.) and share them with your team.

---

## Step 3: Configure Monitors (Alerts)

Monitors are used to notify you when something goes wrong.

1. Navigate to **Monitors > New Monitor**
2. Select a type, like **Metric Monitor**
3. Set the condition

Example:

> Alert if CPU usage is above 80% for 5 minutes:

```text
avg(last_5m):avg:system.cpu.user{env:prod} > 80
```

Configure the alert message and notification channels (Slack, email, PagerDuty).

---

## Step 4: Send Custom Metrics

Use the Datadog Python client to push custom metrics:

```python
from datadog import initialize, api

options = {
    'api_key': 'your_api_key',
    'app_key': 'your_app_key'
}

initialize(**options)

api.Metric.send(
    metric='custom.application.metric',
    points=42
)
```

---

## Step 5: Enable Integrations

Datadog supports integrations with cloud providers and popular tools:

- AWS  
- GCP  
- Azure  
- Docker  
- Kubernetes  
- PostgreSQL  
- Jenkins

To enable:

1. Go to **Integrations > Integrations**
2. Search for the service (e.g., "AWS")
3. Follow the steps to connect using IAM or API keys

---

## Step 6: Automate with Terraform

Datadog resources can be managed as code using Terraform.

Example: Creating a monitor with Terraform

```hcl
resource "datadog_monitor" "cpu_high" {
  name               = "High CPU Usage"
  type               = "metric alert"
  query              = "avg(last_5m):avg:system.cpu.user{env:prod} > 80"
  message            = "CPU usage is above 80% on production!"
  escalation_message = "Immediate action needed."
  tags               = ["env:prod", "team:backend"]
}
```

Install the [Datadog Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/DataDog/datadog/latest) and configure your API and APP keys.

## Step 7: Compare with Grafana + Prometheus

| Feature              | Datadog                       | Grafana + Prometheus             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Setup                | Simple SaaS setup             | Requires hosting & configuration |
| Metrics Collection   | Built-in agent & integrations | Prometheus scrapes metrics       |
| Dashboarding         | Powerful UI                   | Highly customizable              |
| Alerting             | Advanced monitors             | Rules via Alertmanager           |
| Cost                 | Paid (with free trial)        | Free and open source             |

Both are great tools. Datadog is great for quick SaaS-based visibility, while Prometheus + Grafana is ideal for full control in self-hosted environments.

## Tips for Beginners

- Start by monitoring one service or host  
- Use descriptive tags like `env:dev`, `env:prod`, `team:frontend`  
- Use `Notebooks` to document incidents and monitor reviews  
- Set up weekly reports or dashboards for stakeholders  
- Explore log management and APM as your system grows

---

## Conclusion

Datadog helps you monitor everything from infrastructure to applications. With powerful dashboards, easy integrations, and automation support, it's a great choice for any modern DevOps or SRE team.

Happy monitoring! üê∂üìà
