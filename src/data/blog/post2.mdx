# Most Important Linux Commands

Linux commands are essential tools for developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators to interact with the operating system efficiently through the terminal. Hereâ€™s a beginner-friendly guide covering the most useful and frequently used commands.

## File & Directory Management

**List directory contents:**

```bash
ls       # List files in current directory
ls -l    # Long listing format
ls -a    # Show hidden files
```

**Navigate directories:**

```bash
cd /path/to/directory    # Change directory
cd ..                    # Move up one level
pwd                      # Show current directory
```

**Create or delete files and folders:**

```bash
touch file.txt       # Create a file
mkdir new_folder     # Create a directory
rm file.txt          # Delete a file
rm -r folder_name    # Delete folder and contents
```

## File Operations

**Copy, move, rename files:**

```bash
cp file1.txt file2.txt         # Copy file
mv oldname.txt newname.txt     # Rename or move file
```

**View file content:**

```bash
cat file.txt       # View file
less file.txt      # Scrollable view
head file.txt      # First 10 lines
tail file.txt      # Last 10 lines
```

## System Info & Monitoring

**Check system info:**

```bash
uname -a        # Kernel version
df -h           # Disk space usage
free -h         # Memory usage
top             # Real-time process monitoring
htop            # Enhanced top (if installed)
```

**Get IP address:**

```bash
ip a            # Display IP addresses
```

## User Management

**Working with users:**

```bash
whoami                # Current user
sudo su               # Switch to root
adduser newuser       # Add new user
passwd newuser        # Set password
deluser olduser       # Delete user
```

## Permissions

**Check and modify permissions:**

```bash
ls -l                # View permissions
chmod +x script.sh   # Make a file executable
chown user:group file.txt  # Change file ownership
```

## Networking

**Network troubleshooting:**

```bash
ping google.com        # Test connectivity
traceroute google.com  # Trace network route
netstat -tuln          # Show active ports
curl http://example.com  # Fetch web data
```

## Package Management (Debian-based)

```bash
sudo apt update          # Update package list
sudo apt upgrade         # Upgrade packages
sudo apt install nginx   # Install package
sudo apt remove nginx    # Remove package
```

## Process Management

```bash
ps aux              # List running processes
kill <PID>          # Kill a process by PID
killall <name>      # Kill by process name
```

## Archive & Compression

```bash
tar -czvf archive.tar.gz folder/   # Compress
tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz           # Extract
zip file.zip file1.txt file2.txt   # Create ZIP
unzip file.zip                     # Extract ZIP
```
