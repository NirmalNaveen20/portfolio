## What is Terraform?

Terraform, created by HashiCorp, lets you define infrastructure using code (written in HCL - HashiCorp Configuration Language). Instead of clicking through a cloud provider’s UI, you write code to describe resources like servers or databases, and Terraform handles the rest. It supports providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, which is why I find it so versatile.

### Key Concepts

Before jumping into commands, here are the core ideas I always keep in mind:

- **Provider**: The platform you’re managing (e.g., AWS, Azure). You define it in your configuration.
- **Resource**: The building blocks, like an EC2 instance or S3 bucket.
- **Module**: Reusable code blocks for common setups, like a VPC configuration.
- **State**: Terraform’s record of your infrastructure, stored in a `terraform.tfstate` file.
- **Plan**: A preview of changes Terraform will make.
- **Apply**: The action of creating, updating, or deleting resources.

These concepts are the backbone of everything I do with Terraform.

## Essential Terraform Commands

Here are the commands I use most, with examples from my workflow.

**Initialize a Terraform project:**

```bash
terraform init
```

This sets up your project by downloading provider plugins and initializing the backend. I run this first in any new project or cloned repo.

**Validate configuration:**

```bash
terraform validate
```

I use this to catch syntax errors in my `.tf` files before proceeding. It’s a lifesaver for spotting issues early.

**Plan changes:**

```bash
terraform plan
```

This shows what Terraform will do—create, update, or delete resources. I always check the plan to avoid surprises, especially in production.

**Apply changes:**


```bash
terraform apply
```

This creates or updates your infrastructure. It prompts for confirmation unless you add `-auto-approve`. I’m extra cautious with this one.

**Destroy resources:**


```bash
terraform destroy
```

This tears down everything in your configuration. I use it for test environments but double-check the state file first.

**View current state:**

```bash
terraform state list
```

This lists all resources Terraform is managing. It’s great for troubleshooting or checking the state file.

**Refresh state:**

```bash
terraform refresh
```

This syncs the state file with your actual infrastructure. I run it if I suspect manual changes were made outside Terraform.

**Format code:**

```bash
terraform fmt
```

This keeps my `.tf` files clean and consistent. I run it before committing code to git.

Here you can find my repo which I experiment with Terraform codes: [Terraform Experiments](https://github.com/NirmalNaveen20/homelab/tree/main/terraform)



**Output values:**

```bash
terraform output
```

This displays defined outputs, like an EC2 instance’s IP. It’s handy for grabbing values after an apply.

## Writing Terraform Configurations

Here’s a simple AWS EC2 example I might use:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Example AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
  }
}

output "instance_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.web_server.public_ip
}
```

This code sets up an EC2 instance and outputs its public IP. I keep my projects modular with separate files for variables and outputs.

## Best Practices I Follow

Here are some habits I’ve picked up:

- **Use Variables**: Define variables in `variables.tf` for reusability and export secret values like subscriptions ID's to the terminal. 
- **Modularize**: Create modules for common setups to save time.
- **Remote State**: Store state in S3, Azure Blob storage, Terraform Cloud.
- **Lock Versions**: Pin provider versions to avoid unexpected updates.
- **Test First**: Always test in a non-production environment or use workspaces.

## Common Gotchas

A few mistakes I’ve learned to avoid:

- **State File Issues**: Back up your state file and avoid manual infrastructure changes.
- **Version Drift**: Pin provider versions in your config.
- **Sensitive Data**: Use `terraform.tfvars` for secrets and keep them out of git.
